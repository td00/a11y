# a11y for everyone!
Easily add Accessibility Features to any HTML Homepage

Just do the following in your web root:
`git clone https://github.com/td00/a11y`
and add the following 2 lines to any webpage you wanna have this feature:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/a11y/a11y.css" />
<script src="/a11y/a11y.js"></script>
```

If you don't want to selfhost it you can add these lines:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://a11y.tservic.es/a11y.css" />
<script src="https://a11y.tservic.es/a11y.js"></script>
```
